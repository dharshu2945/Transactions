Project Description:

Transactions Management System is a backend-driven web application developed to manage and track financial transactions efficiently. The system allows users to perform core operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing transaction records while maintaining data integrity and structured storage using a relational database.

The application is built using Java (Servlets/JSP) following a layered architecture with DAO and service components to ensure separation of concerns. It integrates with a SQL database for persistent storage and implements CRUD operations with proper validation and exception handling. The project demonstrates practical understanding of backend development, database connectivity (JDBC), session management, and MVC-based design.
